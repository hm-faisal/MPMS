# Bun configuration file
# https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/bunfig
# Equivalent to Jest configuration for consistent testing setup

[test]
# Test file patterns (equivalent to Jest's testMatch)
# Matches all .test.ts files in the test directory

# Coverage settings (equivalent to Jest's coverage config)
coverage = false  # Disabled by default, use --coverage flag to enable
coverageDir = "./coverage"  # equivalent to coverageDirectory
coverageThreshold = 80      # 80% coverage threshold

# Coverage collection patterns (equivalent to collectCoverageFrom)
# Note: Bun collects coverage from tested files by default
# To match Jest behavior, ensure test files import from test/**/*.ts

# Test timeout (in milliseconds)
timeout = 5000

# Bail after first test failure
bail = false

# Module resolution (equivalent to Jest's modulePaths and moduleDirectories)
# Bun automatically resolves from node_modules and supports path mapping via tsconfig.json

# Test environment is always 'node' in Bun (equivalent to Jest's testEnvironment: 'node')

# Supported file extensions (equivalent to Jest's moduleFileExtensions)
# Bun natively supports: .ts, .tsx, .js, .jsx, .mjs, .cjs
